# Waste Volume Prediction using Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network

This project focuses on developing a **time-series waste volume prediction system**
using a **Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. Historical daily waste
data were preprocessed through **normalization** and **outlier handling (Z-Score)**,
then trained with optimized learning rates to accurately capture waste generation
patterns.

## Key Results
- Successfully predicted **daily waste volume for the next 30 days**
- Achieved **low Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.0201)** with an optimal learning rate
- Supports **better landfill capacity planning, budgeting, and operational decision-making**
