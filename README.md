# Waste-VolumePrediction-using-Backpropagation-Artificial-Neural-Network
Developed a time-series waste volume prediction system using a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network. Historical daily waste data were preprocessed through normalization and outlier handling (Z-Score), then trained using optimized learning rates to capture waste generation patterns accurately.
-Successfully predicted daily waste volume for the next 30 days
-Achieved low Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.0201) with optimal learning rate
-The model helps support better landfill capacity planning, budgeting, and operational decision-making
